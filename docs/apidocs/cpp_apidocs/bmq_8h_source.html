@PURPOSE: Public SDK API for the BlazingMQ framework.

@MNEMONIC: BlazingMQ (bmq)

@DESCRIPTION: BlazingmQ (package group &#39;bmq&#39;) is a message-queue
 framework allowing application developers to use reliable distributed queues.

 The &#39;bmqa&#39; and &#39;bmqt&#39; packages contain all components that constitute the
 public API for BlazingmQ users to use.  A client should only use the
 components in these packages, and should not use any other package under the
 &#39;bmq&#39; package group since they are implementation components that may change
 at any time.
